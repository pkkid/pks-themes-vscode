# PKs Themes
This extension includes PKs theme for Visual Studio Code.

This was the old theme I was tough to code with at college in 2000. It's a high
contrast theme primarily using reds with a mix of blues. I feel most would look
in horror at this theme, but it's how my brain thinks.

## Credits
Special thank to Pavel Pertsev, the creator of gruvbox original theme.
Also thanks to jdinhify for the VSCode editor theme colors.
