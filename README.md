# PKs Themes
This extension includes PKs theme for Visual Studio Code.

This was the old theme I was tough to code with at college in 2000. It's a high
contrast theme primarily using reds with a mix of blues. I feel most would look
in horror at this theme, but it's how my brain thinks.

## Installation
This project is not published in the VS Code extensions because it is too tailored
for my own specific needs. If you wanted do something similar for your own vscode,
you can do the following steps.

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Install the "Custom CSS and JS" extension in VSCode.
3. Call the install.sh script to symlink this extension to .vscode/extensions.

## Credits
Special thank to Pavel Pertsev, the creator of gruvbox original theme.
Also thanks to jdinhify for the VSCode editor theme colors.
