# PKs Themes
This extension includes PKs theme for Visual Studio Code.

This was the old theme I was tough to code with at college in 2000. It's a high
contrast theme primarily using reds with a mix of blues. I feel most would look
in horror at this theme, but it's how my brain thinks.

## Installation
This extension can be installed through the extensions sidebar by searching for
"pkkid-themes" or by running `ext install pks-themes` from quick Open (âŒ˜+P).

Also thanks to jdinhify for the VSCode editor theme colors.
